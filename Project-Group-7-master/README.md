CMPE 137 Spartan Drive
Build using UIkit and Firebase
Login, Sign in, Logout has been completed. Other pages have also been made but not finalized
There 2 story boards: a Main one with login and other pages
the second story board is the sign up since i found it easier to work on them this way. (loading many views would lag)
Login is done via Email and Password using User made in Firebase. only one User was made by default.
Sign Up Page will send an email comfirmation when the user sign up. 
Log out uses segue "show detail" instead of "show" so there wouldnt be a back button showing up
Log out is done via Firebase user logout.

*For Professor and Grader* 
ViewController.swift = Default/Login Page 
SignUpPageViewController = Sign Up Page 
MainMenuViewController = Main Menu Page (After Login)
